Solved parts 1 & 2

Part 1 was solved with a flood fill. Part 2 was actually still doable via flood fill, but I was getting the wrong answer, so I read some other peoples' answers and discovered the trick where you can determine if a point is within a boundary by counting the number of non-collinear boundary intersections from the point to the edge of the space.
